## Description

Caching is a critical part of modern software design. It's used to improve performance, reliability, and scalability. Caching works by storing data in a temporary area, making it faster to access, reducing latency, and improving the user experience. Using caching strategies in different ways - from hardware to software, and from the database to the application - can greatly improve software performance.

In this assignment, you will delve into various caching concepts and strategies, understand their applications, and recognize their benefits and trade-offs in software system design. Please refer to the `REPORT.md` file for an outline. Your task is to conduct research and write a report following the guidelines provided. Your report should help readers understand caching and its role in modern software systems.
